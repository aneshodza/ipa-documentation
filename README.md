# IPA Documentation by Anes Hodza
Welcome to my IPA documentation! This IPA was finished on the 5th of juin 2023 at the [Renuo AG](https://www.renuo.ch/). [Here](https://github.com/aneshodza/ipa-documentation/suites/13383152918/artifacts/732417307) you can download the generated PDF and read trough it. Feel free to use this as reference material or just as a template. And speaking of template, this documentation is based on [the IPA LaTeX template by the ictorg](https://github.com/ictorg/ipa-template).  
The source code documented in this project is [gnosis - a Redmine plugin](https://github.com/aneshodza/gnosis).
